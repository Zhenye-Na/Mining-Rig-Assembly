# Mining Rig Assembly

## Description

Mining Rig Assembly is a web application that allows the users to browse different parts of a mining rig, store rig setups, and estimate the performance of their setups on one integrated site. Users can set their expected payback periods for the setups, and our application will calculate the potential profits of them based on real-time price information, and notify the user when their expected payback periods can be achieved. 

## Usefulness

The bitcoin market is growing at an incredible speed because of the bitcoin price surges last year. As a result, many computer components such as GPUs are also experiencing dramatic price changes. Our application aims to help users decide the right time to invest in mining rigs, without having to monitor a large amount of price information at all time. 

Although there are some mining rig profitability calculator websites, but there are several creative features distinguishing us from them:

1. Users can set their expected cost  and expected profit.
2. This website calculates the lowest cost of mining rig by comparing prices from different websites.
3. This website can notify the users when the expected profit is met.
 
## Realness
 
The data we will be using includes price information of computer parts such as GPU, CPU, motherboard, power supply, etc. We plan to collect these data from online hardware retailers such as Newegg and Amazon. We will also need to collect the price information of bitcoins, and we plan to collect it from Google. 

## Description of function:
